Analyze a codebase structure and generate a Mermaid diagram.

This tool scans a directory, identifies key source files and entrypoints, and provides the context needed to generate an architecture diagram.

Features:
- Scans directories for source files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .jsx, .py, .java, etc.)
- Scores and identifies likely entrypoint files (index.*, main.*, app.*, etc.)
- Reads content from top entrypoints to understand code structure
- Generates a simple fallback Mermaid diagram based on directory structure
- Supports rendering to PNG, SVG, or ASCII formats

Output Formats:
- png: High-quality PNG image (requires @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
- svg: Scalable vector graphic (requires @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
- ascii: Terminal-friendly ASCII art (no dependencies)

Usage:
1. Call without mermaid_code to analyze a codebase and get structure info
2. Use the analysis to create a better Mermaid diagram
3. Call again with mermaid_code parameter to render the diagram to an image

Diagrams are saved to the ./diagrams/ directory by default.
